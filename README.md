<As a sociable guy, you may say I'm a peopleâ€™s person! Always had a taste for technologies, solving problems and software as a hole. 
As a salesman I learned how to be persistent, organized, and thrilled by small achievementsâ€¦ 
 When I was thinking of leaving my previous job, and moving to this area there was a client who "sold" me the idea of becoming a <Code Cadet> at <Academia de CÃ³digo_>... It almost sounded like destiny, after so many years selling all kinds of junk I was the one getting a good deal!
So here I am, give me a call!_>
